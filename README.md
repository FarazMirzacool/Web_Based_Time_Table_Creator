"I've developed an interactive Timetable Scheduler that serves as a smart digital worksheet. It doesn't auto-generate the entire schedule, but instead provides me with a visual platform to manually place classes while the system instantly validates my choices and prevents conflicts in real-time."
Human Intelligence + Computer Accuracy: You combine your understanding of subtle priorities (like "Teacher A teaches better in morning slots") with the computer's perfect memory for tracking conflicts.
Flexibility and Control: Unlike a black-box algorithm that might produce illogical timetables, you maintain complete control over the placement of important classes.
Immediate Feedback: The system acts as a vigilant assistant, warning you the moment you try to make an invalid assignment (e.g., double-booking a teacher).
Key Features and Functionality - "What It Does"
Interactive Grid/Calendar View: A central, visual timetable (like a spreadsheet) where you can drag-and-drop or click to assign classes.

Real-Time Conflict Checking: This is the core of your system. The moment you assign a class, it checks:

Is the teacher already busy?

Is the room already occupied?

Is the student group in another class?

If a conflict exists, it immediately highlights the issue (e.g., turns the cell red).

Resource Management Sidebar: Panels that show the current schedule for each teacher and room, updating live as you make assignments.

Visual Availability Highlights: The interface might grey out or suggest slots where a teacher or room is free, making it easier for you to find a valid spot.
